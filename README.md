# **Hummingbirds Unity Machine Learning Agent**
Hummingbird Unity machine learning agent is the artificial intelligent system where I tried to copy the Hummingbird flying nature in Unity game environment and train agents that can navigate to flowers, dip their beaks in, and drink nectar. These hummingbirds have six degrees of freedom, meaning they can fly and turn in any direction to find targets.

These hummingbirds have six degrees of freedom, meaning they can fly and turn in any direction to find targets. They have more complicated controls and their flight paths cannot be solved with traditional navigation systems. In this project I proposed a Reinforcement Learning model with newly Invented [Unity Machine Learning ](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents). 

## **Environment:**

The hummingbird agent is the main machine learning agent and the simulation environment has different kind of  obstacles for the agent. 

The flower and the nectar has following structure
