# Hummingbirds Unity Machine Learing Agent
Hummingbird Unity machine learning agent is the artifical intelligent system where I tried to copy the Hummingbird flying nature in Unity game environment and train agents that can navigate to flowers, dip their beaks in, and drink nectar. These hummingbirds have six degrees of freedom, meaning they can fly and turn in any direction to find targets.
